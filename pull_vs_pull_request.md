5. Difference: Pull vs. Pull Request vs. Push
Push: You are sending your finished work from your computer to GitHub.

Pull: You are grabbing work from GitHub to your computer.

Pull Request: This isn't a "command" but a social request on GitHub to merge code between two different versions of a project.
